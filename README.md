This project aims to revolutionize the way users interact with long-form video content by introducing an intelligent classification and summarization tool tailored for educational videos. Providing cutting-edge topic modeling techniques, this tool will analyze video transcripts to automatically identify key themes and classify content into distinct, searchable sections. Imagine skipping the endless scrolling and instead diving straight into the topics that matter most to you, with crisp, concise summaries that capture the essence of each segment. This innovative approach not only saves time but also transforms video content into a more accessible, navigable, and user-friendly experience. Whether you're a student, professional, or lifelong learner, this tool will redefine how you consume and explore educational content, making the hunt for relevant information quicker, easier, and far more efficient.
